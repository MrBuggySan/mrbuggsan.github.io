We've all been there, stuck on the same problem for hours on end. It is supposed to be simple, you've estimated to finish it in less than 3 hours. But what gives? I'm on my 2nd day already.

Breathe. At times we trust our brain's auto-pilot too much - we say we've seen this exact same problem before. Breathe. Maybe you missed a small detail which you never anticipated? Stand up. Your legs and your body are not meant to stay in one position for long durations. Walk. Focusing on one thing, trying to conjure up all your brainces to break the problem might not be it. Did you know, some of our brightest ideas may come unconsciously?

Take a break.
